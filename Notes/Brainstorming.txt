NPCS:
	Sanity Draining Mobs
	Dark Monsters
	Orb Eaters

Ideas:
	Achor falling down and down and down [why?]
	
	Fishing lure that needs to descend [why?]
	
	A diver going down [why?]
	
	Would be cool if you're riding the anchor
		Run left and right on the anchor (WASD)/Controller
		You grab the center and then pull it to the left or right (click to pull/R2)

EnvironmentalSpawner:
	Spawns everything like Mobs and Ground or Pickups/Points
	
	Has a property called "is_falling"
		All spawns listen for "is_falling" and apply reverse gravity if this is true
	
	If a Ground entity is hit by the anchor
		it sends up a signal to the EnvironmentalSpawner to set is_falling = false


STORY:
	Objective is to resurface at some point
	
	Call to adventure -> 
	Find what you need/Dont get what you want -> 
	Learn a lesson -> 
	Return having changed ->
	
	The anchor is what anchors him
		Good way? Bad way?
		
	You are not attached to anything, you're just free falling
	
	The anchor is what "anchors you"
		so you need to protect it, and stay near it (aka don't fall off)
			As you fall into the depths of madness you stay tethered to that which is untethered
				The anchor

	At some point you make it through
		and the lighting reverses and everything spawns upside down
			as you move "down" but are actually moving "up"
	
	"You need to survive the trip"
	
	You die if:
		If your anchor loses health 
		You fall off
		Something kills you

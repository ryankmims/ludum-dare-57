Theme: Depths

Ideas:
	Achor falling down and down and down [why?]
	
	Fishing lure that needs to descend [why?]
	
	A diver going down [why?]
	
	Would be cool if you're riding the anchor
		Run left and right on the anchor (WASD)/Controller
		You grab the center and then pull it to the left or right (click to pull/R2)

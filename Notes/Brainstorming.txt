Theme: Depths

Ideas:
	Achor falling down and down and down [why?]
	
	Fishing lure that needs to descend [why?]
	
	A diver going down [why?]
	
	Would be cool if you're riding the anchor
		Run left and right on the anchor (WASD)/Controller
		You grab the center and then pull it to the left or right (click to pull/R2)



EnvironmentalSpawner:
	Spawns everything like Mobs and Ground or Pickups/Points
	
	Has a property called "is_falling"
		All spawns listen for "is_falling" and apply reverse gravity if this is true
	
	If a Ground entity is hit by the anchor
		it sends up a signal to the EnvironmentalSpawner to set is_falling = false


STORY:
	Objective is to resurface at some point
	
	Call to adventure -> 
	Find what you need/Dont get what you want -> 
	Learn a lesson -> 
	Return having changed ->
	
	The anchor is what anchors him
		Good way? Bad way?
		
	You are not attached to anything, you're just free falling
